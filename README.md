âœ… Flight Booking System â€“ Users can specify departure & return dates, destinations, and class preferences.
âœ… Dynamic Pricing & Classes â€“ Supports Hospitality & Business classes with price calculations.
âœ… Interactive Console-Based UI â€“ Uses Scanner input for a seamless user experience.
âœ… Custom Booking Confirmation â€“ Displays a formatted summary of the reservation.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:

Java (Core Java, OOP Principles)
Console-based User Input (Scanner Class)
Conditional Statements & Loops
ðŸŽ¯ Future Enhancements:
ðŸ”¹ Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing.
ðŸ”¹ Database Integration for real-time booking storage.
ðŸ”¹ Online API Integration for actual airline data retrieval.
